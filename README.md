### How does it works?
you need to press any of the key that are shown and the will not only make a different sound, they also will change the background with an image! (not necessarily related to the sound).

pretty cool right? but
### Why did you create it using react and typeScript if it is a javaScript challenge?
the answer is pretty simple, i wanted to challenge myself, i havent use typescript that much and now implementing it with react is a good deal for me ^^.
